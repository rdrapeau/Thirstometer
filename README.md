Thirstometer

This was an application built for a Google Cloud Platform Hackathon. The basic idea of the application is to allow users to track their daily consumption of liquids and water. Any time a user finishes a bottle or drinks a glass of water, he or she can click a button on this app which logs the time and amount ingested. A graph is then displayed using the Google Charts API showing the user their daily / all-time consumption over the timeline.
